Scripts used to prepare DNA nanodisc structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

* [merge_dna_lipids_mdanalysis.ipynb](merge_dna_lipids_mdanalysis.ipynb)
Merges DNA and lipid bilayer structures into a single `.gro` file using MDAnalysis.
* [pymol_visualize_nanodisc.pml](pymol_visualize_nanodisc.pml)
PyMOL script used to visualize the DNA nanodisc system and highlight DNA strands,
alkyl chains, and lipid bilayer components.

* [remove_clashing_lipids_mdanalysis.ipynb](remove_clashing_lipids_mdanalysis.ipynb) Identifies lipid residues (DMPC, DMTAP) that are closer than 2.5 Å to DNA atoms
and removes them using MDAnalysis. The cleaned structure is written to a new GRO file.

* [estimate_nanodisc_lipid_composition.ipynb](estimate_nanodisc_lipid_composition.ipynb) Calculates the estimated number of lipids required to build the DNA nanodisc
based on DNA length, geometry, and effective lipid area per lipid (APL).
Outputs the expected number of DMPC and DMTAP molecules.

* [generate_dna_basepair_restraints.ipynb](generate_dna_basepair_restraints.ipynb)
Identifies complementary DNA base pairs using N1/N3 atoms and generates
distance restraints for GROMACS simulations. The script creates topology
entries that enforce base-pair distances during the simulation.

Extract DNA Sequence (including modified bases) from GROMACS .gro files using MDAnalysis
